## Purpose
The app aims to help with the problem of malnutrition of children in the Philippines by encouraging its users to eat healthy and help prevent children from around the country from becoming malnourished.


### The Problem
Malnutrition affects 1 out of 3 Filipino children below 5 years old, resulting in them being underweight and/or [stunted](http://www.who.int/nutrition/healthygrowthproj_stunted_videos/en/) ([1](#references)).

[![Indicators of Undernutrition](http://cnnphilippines.com/incoming/v1jrb-02_Undernutrition-infograhics_CNNPH.png/ALTERNATES/FREE_720/02_Undernutrition-infograhics_CNNPH.png "Indicators of Undernutrition")](http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/08/31/save-the-children-malnutrition-philippines.html)

The 2015 data from the _Department of Science and Technology-Food and Nutrition Research Institute (DOST-FNRI)_ revealed that the Philippine chronic malnutrition rate among children aged 0 to 2 years old was at 26.2%, the highest in 10 years ([4](#references)).  The FNRI's data from that year also showed that the country also failed to reach its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to reduce the percentage of underweight children ([5](#references)).

The effects of malnutrition to children, specifically stunting, not only affects their growth and development permanently, but also the income of both the family and the country entirely.

[![Stunting](https://assets.rappler.com/612F469A6EA84F6BAE882D2B94A4B421/img/919AE9CCB88242F28277D539A181C7B2/infographic-stunting-page-001-1_919AE9CCB88242F28277D539A181C7B2.jpg "Stunting")](https://www.rappler.com/nation/181340-dswd-deped-budget-malnutrition)

According to _Save the Children_, an international non-government organization, children who were stunted in the first two years of their lives would tend to drop out of schools and repeat grade levels. This results to an increase of education costs for those who repeat grade levels. For those who drop out, they become members of the workforce with low level income due to low level education. Another possible result is the premature death of the child who would've been part of the country's workforce. These results amounted to ₱328 billion education and productivity losses for the country in 2013, which was almost 3% of that year's GDP ([3](#references)).

From 2013 to 2015, the cases of childhood stunting in Filipino children grew to 30.3% to 33.4%, and according to  Ned Olney, country director of Save the Children Philippines, “If stunting rates continue to rise, it would be difficult for families to break free from poverty. It is the poor and neglected sectors of society that carry the burden of stunting. Any investment in reducing childhood undernutrition will reduce suffering and poverty, and will ultimately stimulate economic growth for all Filipinos.” ([3](#references))


### The Proposed Solution
Current solutions for malnutrition of children in the Philippines include informing the public, especially parents, about healthy diets ([7, 8](#references)) and conducting feeding programs to communities ([9](#references)).

The solution this app proposes is to let users be a part of these solutions without needing to go out of their way to do so. Here's how it basically works:
- Users search for a restaurant they want to eat in and make a reservation in that restaurant.
    - Consider a user too busy with work (or life in general). It's highly likely that he/she won't have time to cook his/her own meals and will rely on nearby restaurants for a quick food supply. Restaurants tend to run out of seats especially during lunch break. So a reservation can secure a seat for the user.
- After completing a reservation and purchasing food from the restaurant, a certain amount of the pay will be donated to organizations that conduct feeding programs to malnourished children in the country.
    - So this is what makes the reservation app somehow unique. In fulfilling the user's hunger, he/she was also able to help donate food for malnourished children indirectly. The user didn't have to get out of his/her daily routine to do so. He/she just had to take care of his hunger in order to live.
- The user will now be able to rate the restaurant based on "healthiness" and cost.
    - In order to help inform others about healthy eating, the app will allow the user to rate a restaurant based on their meals' "healthiness". The National Nutrition Council (NNC) reminds parents that as a rule of thumb, children past the breastfeeding age should always have four things on their plate: carbohydrates, protein, vegetables, and plenty of fruit ([10](#references)). So the user can probably rate it based on that, or on his/her own personal knowleddge of a healthy meal.
    - Users can also rate restaurants based on cost. That way, other users can choose a restaurant with their preferred ratio of health and cost. Here's where they can fulfill their hunger while keeping healthy about it.

Though this is not an entirely unique way of solving malnutrition, it does help the existing solutions by allowing more people to participate even without being physically present.

## Design
    * wireframe
    * figma screenshot
    * ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram)

## The Name
  Since our app has similar features to that of Grab Taxi and Uber, we decided to make spoofs of those names. At the moment of writing this, we came up with 'Grub Tasty', 'Grubber', and 'Maize', though the last one was mostly because DMonMac was playing around.

## Tools and Methodologies
