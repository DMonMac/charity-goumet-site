## THE PLAN
- ## Purpose
  - ### The Problem
    Malnutrition affects 1 out of 3 Filipino children below 5 years old, resulting in them being underweight and/or [stunted](http://www.who.int/nutrition/healthygrowthproj_stunted_videos/en/) ([a](#sources)).

    [![Indicators of Undernutrition](http://cnnphilippines.com/incoming/v1jrb-02_Undernutrition-infograhics_CNNPH.png/ALTERNATES/FREE_720/02_Undernutrition-infograhics_CNNPH.png "Indicators of Undernutrition")](http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2016/08/31/save-the-children-malnutrition-philippines.html)

    The 2015 data from the _Department of Science and Technology-Food and Nutrition Research Institute (DOST-FNRI)_ revealed that the Philippine chronic malnutrition rate among children aged 0 to 2 years old was at 26.2%, the highest in 10 years ([d](#sources)).  The FNRI's data from that year also showed that the country also failed to reach its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) to reduce the percentage of underweight children ([e](#sources)).

    The effects of malnutrition to children, specifically stunting, not only affects their growth and development permanently, but also the income of both the family and the country entirely.

    According to _Save the Children_, an international non-government organization, children who were stunted in the first two years of their lives would tend to drop out of schools and repeat grade levels. This results to an increase of education costs for those who repeat grade levels. For those who drop out, they become members of the workforce with low level income due to low level education. Another possible result is the premature death of the child who would've been part of the country's workforce. These results amounted to ₱328 billion education and productivity losses for the country in 2013, which was almost 3% of that year's GDP ([c](#sources)).

    From 2013 to 2015, the cases of childhood stunting in Filipino children grew to 30.3% to 33.4%, and according to  Ned Olney, country director of Save the Children Philippines, “If stunting rates continue to rise, it would be difficult for families to break free from poverty. It is the poor and neglected sectors of society that carry the burden of stunting. Any investment in reducing childhood undernutrition will reduce suffering and poverty, and will ultimately stimulate economic growth for all Filipinos.” ([c](#sources))

- ## Design
    * wireframe
    * figma screenshot
    * ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram)

- ## The Name
  Since our app has similar features to that of Grab Taxi and Uber, we decided to make spoofs of those names. At the moment of writing this, we came up with 'Grub Tasty', 'Grubber', and 'Maize', though the last one was mostly because DMonMac was playing around.
