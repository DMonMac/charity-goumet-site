Hearty laughter and hearty meals – mention Mitos and these two things come to mind immediately!
Mitos grew up in the kitchens of the women of her family, easily the most exclusive culinary
education one could imagine. There she was initiated into the pleasures of food made with love.
When Mitos began her own family she chose Baguio to be the city in which to keep a hearth burning.

Kalorisma! We're Baguio's first authentic Greek restaurant.
Our very own Chef Takis is from Athens, Greece.
Everyday he cooks his favorite Greek dishes using some ingredients straight from his homeland.
Picture a taste of Greece!
