Arca’s Yard is located along Baguio-Ambuklao Road,
far away from the hustle and bustle of the Central Business District.
At Arca’s Yard can you find a breathtaking, panoramic view of Baguio City because of its high location.
It is a place where you can experience a quiet ambience with the presence of nature around and the feeling of nostalgic Baguio.

Hearty laughter and hearty meals – mention Mitos and these two things come to mind immediately!
Mitos grew up in the kitchens of the women of her family, easily the most exclusive culinary
education one could imagine. There she was initiated into the pleasures of food made with love.
When Mitos began her own family she chose Baguio to be the city in which to keep a hearth burning.

Kalorisma! We're Baguio's first authentic Greek restaurant.
Our very own Chef Takis is from Athens, Greece.
Everyday he cooks his favorite Greek dishes using some ingredients straight from his homeland.
Picture a taste of Greece!

LE CHEF AT THE MANOR by Chef Billy King is regarded as the BEST fine-dining restaurant in Baguio.
People would go up to Baguio just to taste Chef Billy King's food with the classic Baguio log cabin ambiance.
It's lovely to dine here during the Yuletide season with the cold Baguio breeze caressing customers
while Christmas tunes play softly in the background.

The Chef Vicky in Mercato Centrale, with her stall selling her yummy goodies from Baguio, when we first opened in 2010.
She offers an 8-course, French-inspired, strictly-by-reservation private dining in her lovely home in Baguio.
She only accepts strictly one group at a time, with a minimum of 6 persons.
There is no menu, so just be prepared to be surprised with the 3-hour, 8-course Degustation Meal.

Coffee & Pine is newly opened and is fast to climb this list.
Every corner of the place is just IG worthy. It also has an
overlooking view of the mountains and the pine trees.
They have a good mix of cakes, meals, sandwiches which is also well presented.
